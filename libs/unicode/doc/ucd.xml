<title>The Unicode Character Database</title>

<para>The information provided in the Unicode Character Database is in a machine readable form, but not one that is useful for programmatically processing data according to the Unicode rules.
Therefore, we wrote a parser that converts UCD files published on the <ulink url="http://www.unicode.org/ucd">Unicode web site</ulink> into C++.</para>

<para>The system that uses the output of the data reader can be targeted at a particular version of the Unicode specification, and upgraded to the latest version of the Unicode specification as soon as new UCD files are published.
Additionally program-specific private range data can be incorporated into a single, unified database, targeted at a particular solution, without any special handling or change in performance.</para>
